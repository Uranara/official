    "p1": "Nowadays, the \"dual carbon\" policy has penetrated into various industries, and China's pace of \"dual carbon\" is constantly accelerating. However, in 2020, the total carbon emissions from the entire construction process in China were 5.08 billion tons of carbon dioxide, accounting for 50.9% of the country's carbon emissions. Therefore, the low-carbon topic in the construction field continues to rise in popularity. There is an enterprise in Ningbo that focuses on the research and production of Wuheng intelligent air conditioning. They propose the noble pursuit of leading smart living and creating a better life, while providing indoor microenvironment and carbon neutral solutions for China's future construction industry. In this episode, we will follow our camera and walk into Furuna (Ningbo) Technology Co., Ltd. to explore a new low-carbon technology future in the field of architecture.",
    "p2": "This episode tells the story of Freena (Ningbo) Technology Co., Ltd., a high-tech enterprise that integrates the research and development, production, sales, and service of Wuheng intelligent air conditioners, through four major chapters. With its forward-looking and leading technological advantages, it is at the forefront of the industry and has become the only company in China with a complete set of independently invented core patented technology products. The company is driven by core technology, led by advanced brands, and guided by intelligent services, providing a one-stop solution for upgrading future urban life in all formats, cycles, intelligence, and digitization, committed to becoming a leader in smart manufacturing.",
    "p3": "Freena Wuheng Intelligent Air Conditioning has three major technological innovations: new radiant panel technology, intelligent fresh air system, and central control system. Among the three major technological innovations of Freena, the central control system is the key. In response, Mr. Wang Daduo, CEO of Furuna (Ningbo) Technology Co., Ltd., stated in an interview that the central control systems of similar products on the market are generally household level AI controls, and Furuna pioneered over three programming languages to achieve aerospace industry level programming. Through sensors on each component module, real-time tracking and monitoring of indoor air, sound, water flow and other parameters can be achieved, achieving balance regulation and intelligent zoning control.",
    "p4": "On the basis of the three major system innovations, the application of Freena's five black technologies relies on the patented technology independently developed by Furuna Technology to upgrade quality and technology to a higher level of innovation. The selection of materials is a prerequisite for any innovation and technology, so among the five black technologies, the selection of materials ranks first.\n\nDifferent from the civilian grade materials used in the same industry, we choose industrial grade materials that can meet aerospace standards. For example, in the selection of plastic materials for water pipes and accessories in radiation panels, the lifespan of civilian grade plastics is 20 years. However, after various stages such as hot melting, processing, shaping, and installation, the actual service life is only 5 to 6 years, while the lifespan of industrial grade plastics can reach 50 years. Therefore, material selection can fundamentally eliminate the common 5% repair rate after three to five years in the industry.",
    "p5": "As a leader in low-carbon building concepts, Furuna Technology has set a new example for low-carbon energy conservation in China's construction territory. By continuously promoting the three major technological innovations of new radiation panel technology, intelligent fresh air system, and central control system, as well as using the leading application of the five major black technologies, we aim to make buildings better understand low-carbon energy conservation, and make technology more emotional and warm. I believe that in the near future, Furunad Wuheng Intelligent Air Conditioning will enter every Chinese household, providing people with intelligent and comfortable living experiences.\n\n"

    "p1": "Research has shown that three-quarters of a person's life is spent indoors, and indoor air quality is closely related to the health of the population. With the continuous improvement of material living standards, people's requirements for living environment are also constantly increasing. Temperature, humidity, air quality, and other invisible values have gradually become essential for a healthy and comfortable life. Furunad Wuheng Intelligent Air Conditioning not only meets the needs of ideal living, but also completely solves all previous air conditioning problems. It is a truly intelligent air conditioner that does not require blowing air.",
    "p2": "The Five Constants refer to the healthy ecological living environment that achieves constant temperature, humidity, oxygen, cleanliness, and stillness indoors, achieved through the joint action of new radiation panels, fresh air systems, mixed water systems, and central control systems. The third-generation temperature control panel technology effectively saves 80% of energy, making it a truly non drying intelligent air conditioner. It has overcome the technical problems of similar products on the market, such as not being able to open doors and windows at will, being prone to condensation, and mold, and making its operation more stable and energy-saving. It performs better than similar products in Europe.",
    "p3": "Constant temperature: refers to the working temperature of the human body, which is jointly affected by air temperature and radiation temperature. Reaching a temperature that is thermally neutral without fluctuations, the human cold and hot neurons are insensitive, achieving thermal balance between the human body and the environment.\n\nConstant humidity: When we say constant humidity, we refer to absolute humidity, which includes moisture content, dew point, and partial pressure of water vapor. All three are acceptable, not relative humidity. Comfort or not depends on the environmental requirements for humidity, the degree of dryness and wetness of the skin and seasonal changes, the relationship between humidity and skin heat dissipation, relative humidity or absolute humidity. Setting aside these aspects, it is untenable to discuss them.\n\nConstant oxygen: It is independent of oxygen concentration, mainly carbon dioxide concentration, which can represent the condition of pollutants.\n\nHengjie: Freena's hourly pure fresh air volume index is required to be 9 times higher than the national standard, and all indoor pollutant indicators are required to be higher than the national standard, with some exceeding the European standard requirements. Pollutants represented by carbon dioxide include particulate matter, gaseous pollutants, and microorganisms. The methods for its discharge include natural ventilation and mechanical ventilation; Mechanical ventilation is further divided into mixed ventilation and displacement ventilation.\n\nHengjing: mainly refers to the noise index. The source of indoor noise is not only the fan coil unit at the end of the air conditioning system, but also the urban noise caused by window opening. Opening windows by 10%, outdoor noise entering 70%, opening 30% entering over 90%. Without opening windows and pure fresh air replacement, indoor pollutants cannot be effectively discharged. Freena has excellent control over environmental background noise due to the absence of windows.",
    "p4": "Freena continues to promote a humanized intelligent experience, pioneering the application of over three languages in programs to meet the requirements of aerospace industry grade operating systems. The system is endowed with a human like \"brain,\" \"eyes,\" and \"limbs,\" enabling adaptation between the system and humans. Real time indoor air data collection is completed in 3 seconds, and operation instructions are given to various components of the system based on data feedback analysis, without the need for any operation.\n\n",
    "p5": "The company is driven by core technology, guided by ecological development, and guided by intelligent services, providing a comfortable, healthy, and convenient one-stop solution for future urban life upgrades. As an innovative technology in the field of architecture, with its outstanding energy-saving performance and profound understanding of the environment, it helps buildings achieve the goal of near zero carbon emissions and is leading the future development of green buildings.\n\n",
    "p6": "The Freena indoor environment adaptive system, with its excellent performance and intelligent control system, can be widely used in office, medical, leisure and entertainment, cultural and other fields, such as office buildings, high-end hotels, clubs, hospitals, sanatoriums, postpartum centers, museums, opera houses and other space scenes. Its constant temperature, humidity, oxygen, cleanliness, cleanliness, and adaptive intelligent control characteristics not only meet the pursuit of health, comfort, and efficiency in modern indoor living environments, but also become a model for promoting sustainable urban development."
